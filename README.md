My name is Jonathan Klimp. Currently I am studying Bio-informatics at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. 
And I am an intern at the UMCG departement of Genetics and working on reseaching and implementing non-coding functionality into [VIP](https://github.com/molgenis/vip)
I am a realistic loyal guy who likes programming and learn new things. I completed the minor Application Design. 
There I am learned to build better applications which is something I like doing. The programming languages I know are: Java, javascript, Pyhon, and R. 
I have the most recent experience in Java, I have used this language for my minor, Internship (together with javascript and VUE.js), and graduation project (together with R and Shell)

Currently working on:
