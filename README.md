My name is Jonathan Klimp. Currently I a bachelor Bio-informatics. I completed this bachelor at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. 
I am a realistic loyal guy who likes programming and learn new things. I completed the minor Application Design,
there I am learned to build better applications with java spring-boot. The programming languages/frameworks I know are: Java, javascript, Pyhon, HTML, CSS, Angular, VUEjs, graphQL, java spring and R. 
I have the most recent experience in Java, I have used this language for my minor, Internship (together with javascript and VUE.js), graduation project (together with R and Shell), and during the Traineeship Java developer at DUO.


Interesting projects I worked on:
- Traineeship project: A spring project with angular frondend and spring backend with a connection to a mysql database. Is a website where you can compare prices of food products of the most popular supermarkets in the Netherlands. [Boodschappenvergelijker](https://github.com/JonathanKlimp/boodschappen_vergelijker)
