My name is Jonathan Klimp. Currently I am studying Bio-informatics at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. 
I am a realistic loyal guy who likes programming and learn new things. I just finished the minor Application Design. 
There I am learned to build better applications which is something I like doing. The programming languages I know are: Python, Java, javascript, and R. 

Interesting projects I worked on:

Pedigree tracker website. Built with java/javascript * https://bitbucket.org/JonathanKlimp/thema10/src/master/

Trying to use machine learning for quarantining animals after a biting incident. * https://bitbucket.org/JonathanKlimp/thema09/src/master/

Building a website for providing de-prescribing information for drugs * https://github.com/MinorApplicationDesign/MinorApplicationDesign
